		/* CHALLENGE #1: Testing infrastructure with narrow integration tests
		 *
		 * Infrastructure can be tricky to test because it often involves complicated setup. In the case of the
		 * CommandLine infrastructure wrapper, the tests have run some of their code in a separate process, so they
		 * can control the child process's args, stdout, and stderr. I've simplified these challenges by providing
		 * the tests.
		 *
		 * This is what this first test is doing (pseudocode):
		 *    // create process with the arguments "my arg 1" and "my arg 2"
		 *    const commandLine = CommandLine.create();
		 *    assert.deepEqual(commandLine.args(), [ "my arg 1", "my arg 2" ];
		 *
		 * Remove the ".skip" from this test and implement CommandLine.args().
		 *
		 * Hints:
		 *
		 * 1. In Node.js, process arguments are provided by the "process" global. Specifically, in "process.argv".
		 *
		 * 2. The first two arguments will be the "node" and the name of the file. The real arguments come after that.
		 * You'll need to strip out the first two arguments. One way to do so is "process.argv.slice(2)".
		 *

		 * having to spawn a separate process.

		 * Remove the ".skip" from this test and implement CommandLine.trackStdout(). Then uncomment the commented-out
		 * lines in the test and implement CommandLine.trackStderr().
		 *
		 * Don't worry about the extra test output for this challenge.
		 *
		 * Hints:
		 *
		 * 1. There's a helper method for tracking output already written. To use it, you need an event emitter and the
		 * name of an event. Then you can use it like this:
		 *    trackStdout() {
		 *      return infrastructureHelper.trackOutput(this._emitter, STDOUT_EVENT);
		 *    }
		 *
		 * 2. To create the emitter, call "new EventEmitter()".

		 *    this._emitter.emit(STDOUT_EVENT, "my data");

			/* CHALLENGE #4: Nullable output
			 *
			 * After finishing the previous challenge, you'll see garbage in the test output. That's because
			 * CommandLine.writeStdout() and .writeStderr() are writing test output to the command line. We need a
			 * way of turning it off.
			 *
			 * Although this can be implemented with a flag and a bunch of "if" statements, the cleanest way to implement
			 * it is with a small stub of the "process" global.
			 *
			 * Remove the ".skip" from this test and implement CommandLine.createNull(), along with enough of a stub
			 * for the stdout assertion to pass. Then uncomment the second assertion in the test and expand the stub so
			 * the stderr assertion passes, too.
			 *
			 * After the test is working, update the test code for challenge #3 so it no longer writes to the command line.
			 *
			 * This is what this test is doing (pseudocode):
			 *    // in a separate process
			 *    const commandLine = CommandLine.create();
			 *    commandLine.writeStdout("this stdout should never be seen"");
			 *    commandLine.writeStderr("this stderr shouldn't be seen either");
			 *    // in this process
			 *    const { stdout, stderr } = // results of running process
			 *    assert.equal(stdout, "my stdout");
			 *    assert.equal(stderr, "my stderr");
			 *
			 * Hints:
			 *
			 * 1. Start by making "process" injectable. Pass the "process" global from create() into the constructor and
			 * store it in "this._process."
			 *
			 * 2. Modify writeStdout() to use "this._process" instead of the process global. Now you can control which
			 * code writeStdout() runs.
			 *
			 * 3. Remove the ".skip" from this test. It will complain createNull() is not a function. Implement it, but
			 * just duplicate create() for now. The test will fail correctly, showing that stdout is being written when
			 * it shouldn't be.
			 *
			 * 4. Now make a "NullProcess" class and have createNull() use an instance of that instead, like this:
			 *    return new CommandLine(new NullProcess());
			 * 
			 * 5. The code will fail because this._process.stdout is undefined. You need NullProcess to implement a
			 * stdout accessor that returns a do-nothing write() function, like this:
			 * 	  class NullProcess {
			 *      get stdout() {
			 *        return {
			 *          write() {}
			 *        };
			 *      }
			 *    }
			 *
			 * 7. Repeat for stderr.
			 *
			 * 8. To prevent the challenge #3 test from writing to the command line, change "CommandLine.create()" to
			 * "CommandLine.createNull()".
			 *

			 * expand your process stub to support args() as well.
			 *
			 * Hints:
			 *
			 * 1. You'll need to modify CommandLine.args() to use this._process rather than the process global.
			 *
			 * 2. You'll also need to expand the stub to provide an "argv" accessor, like this:

			 *
			 * Some tests will need to configure the response provided by commandLine.args(). Remove the ".skip" from this
			 * test and modify CommandLine.createNull() to support an optional "args" parameter.
			 *
			 * When you're done with this challenge, if there's still time remaining, look for opportunities to refactor.
			 * Then take a look at the HttpServer infrastructure wrapper (in http/http_server.js). It's more complicated
			 * than CommandLine, but uses an embedded stub just like CommandLine. Look at the code and figure out how
			 * the stub works.
			 *
			 * If you still have additional time, look at the HttpClient wrapper (in http/http_client.js). It's the most
			 * complicated infrastructure wrapper, but implemented in the same way as CommandLine. Look at the
			 * trackRequests() method and compare it to CommandLine.trackStdout(). Then look at the stub code and compare
			 * it to the NullProcess stub in CommandLine.
			 *
			 * Hints:
			 *
			 * 1. To take an optional parameter in CommandLine.createNull(), use object destructuring, like this:
			 *    static createNull({ args = [] } = {}) {
			 *
			 * (The above code says, "createNull() takes one parameter which defaults to an empty object. That empty
			 * object has a field named args, which defaults to an empty array if it isn't found.")
			 *
			 * 2. You'll need to store the arguments. Pass them to the NullProcess constructor and put them in an instance
			 * variable.
			 *
			 * 3. Return the arguments instance variable in NullProcess.argv, but remember that CommandLine.args() strips
			 * off the first two parameters, so you'll need to add two dummy parameters. I did it like this:
			 *    return [ "null_process_node", "null_process_script.js", ...this._args ];
			 *
