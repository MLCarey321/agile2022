			/* CHALLENGE #1: Using nullable infrastructure
			 *
			 * We're going to start off nice and easy. For this first challenge, all you need to do is make the
			 * HomePageController return the home page when it receives a GET request.
			 *
			 * Useful methods:
			 *
			 * 1. const controller = HomePageController.createNull() - create a HomePageController.
			 * 2. const request = HttpRequest.createNull() - create an HttpRequest.
			 * 3. const config = WwwConfig.createNull() - create a WwwConfig.
			 * 4. const response = await controller.getAsync(request, config) - handles the GET request.
			 * 5. const response = homePageView.homePage() - render the home page.
			 * 6. assert.deepEqual(actual, expected) - compare two objects.
			 *
			 * Hints:
			 *
			 * 1. Your test will need a HomePageController. You can construct it with HomePageController.createNull():
			 *    const controller = HomePageController.createNull();
			 *
			 * 2. Your test will need to simulate a GET request. You can do that by calling controller.getAsync(). Don't
			 * forget to 'await' it.
			 *
			 * 3. getAsync() expects a 'HttpRequest' object and a 'WwwConfig' object. (The router passes these two
			 * parameters to every controller method.) Both of them can be instantiated by calling their createNull()
			 * static methods:
			 *    const request = HttpRequest.createNull();
			 *    const config = WwwConfig.createNull();
			 *    const response = await controller.getAsync(request, config);
			 *
			 * 4. You'll need an 'expected' value to compare against the results of getAsync(). You can use
			 * homePageView.homePage() as your expected value.
			 *    const expected = homePageView.homePage();
			 *
			 * 5. Use assert.deepEqual() to make the comparison. It checks that the contents of two objects are identical.
			 *    assert.deepEqual(response, expected);
			 *
			 * 6. When you run the test, it will fail with "unexpected undefined to deep equal HttpResponse..." This means
			 * getAsync() isn't returning a value.
			 *
			 * 7. Make the test pass by having getAsync() return the home page:
			 *    return homePageView.homePage()

			/* CHALLENGE #2a: Tracking requests
			 *
			 * This is a lot more challenging! You need to make HomePageController call the ROT-13 service when it
			 * receives a POST request. To make this easier, the challenge is broken up into three parts.
			 *
			 * For part (a), make the HomePageController call the ROT-13 service when it receives a POST request.
			 * Use a hard-coded port and text. You don't need to worry about the response for this challenge. Don't
			 * worry about errors or edge cases either.
			 *
			 * Useful methods:
			 *
			 * 1. const controller = HomePageController.createNull({ rot13Client }) - create a HomePageController that
			 *      uses the provided rot13Client. Note that the parameter is an object with an optional field named
			 *      "rot13Client". Don't forget the curly braces. If you use a different variable name for your rot13Client,
			 *      you have to specify it, like this: createNull({ rot13Client: myDifferentName });
			 * 2. const rot13Client = Rot13Client.createNull() - create a Rot13Client.
			 * 3. const rot13Requests = rot13Client.trackRequests() - track requests made to rot13Client. This returns a
			 *      reference to an empty array on the heap. Every time a new request is made of rot13Client, an object
			 *      describing the request is appended to the array. The object looks like this:
			 *          {
			 *            port: 123,          // The port of the ROT-13 service
			 *            text: "some text"   // The text sent to the service
			 *          }
			 * 4. const response = await controller.postAsync(request, config) - handles the POST request.
			 * 5. const transformedText = await rot13Client.transformAsync(port, text) - call the ROT-13 service.
			 *
			 * Hints:
			 *
			 * 1. When you called HomePageController.createNull() in the last challenge, it created the Rot13Client for you.
			 * But in this challenge, youâ€™ll need access to the Rot13Client instance in your test, so you'll need to create
			 * it in your test and pass it into HomePageController, like this:
			 *    const rot13Client = Rot13Client.createNull();
			 *    const controller = HomePageController.createNull({ rot13Client });
			 *
			 * 2. Your test needs to see which requests have been made to the ROT-13 service. You can do that by calling
			 * rot13Client.trackRequests(). It returns an array that is updated every time a new request is made. Note that
			 * you have to call trackRequests() BEFORE making the request:
			 *    const rot13Requests = rot13Client.trackRequests();
			 *
			 * 3. To simulate a POST request, call controller.postAsync(). It expects HttpRequest and WwwConfig parameters,
			 * just like getAysnc() did in Challenge #1. This time, though, you can ignore the response, because your
			 * assertion will look at rot13Requests instead.
			 *    const request = HttpRequest.createNull();
			 *    const config = WwwConfig.createNull();
			 *    await controller.postAsync(request, config);
			 *
			 * 4. Compare the rot13Requests array (from rot13Client.trackRequests()) to your expected requests using
			 * assert.deepEqual(). It will contain an array of objects. Each object represents a single request. Since
			 * you're only expecting the production code to make one request, you can expect an array with one object.
			 * Like this:
			 *    assert.deepEqual(rot13Requests, [{
			 *      port: 123,           // The port of the ROT-13 service
			 *      text: "some text",   // The text sent to the service
			 *    }]);
			 *
			 * 5. When you run the test, it will fail saying the actual value is "[]" (an empty array. This means your
			 * production code isn't make any ROT-13 service requests.
			 *
			 * 6. You can call the ROT-13 service in your production code by using this._rot13Client.transformAsync().
			 * You can hardcode the port and text for this challenge, and you don't need to worry about the return value.
			 * Like this:
			 *    await this._rot13Client.transformAsync(123, "some text");
			 *

		/* CHALLENGE #2b: Dynamic port
		 *
		 * For this challenge, modify the test and production code created in Challenge #2a. Change it to use the
		 * ROT-13 service port provided in WwwConfig rather than hard-coding the value.
		 *
		 * Useful methods:
		 *
		 * 1. const config = WwwConfig.createNull({ rot13ServicePort }) - create a WwwConfig with the provided ROT-13
		 *      service port. Note that the parameter is an object with an optional field named "rot13ServicePort".
		 * 2. const port = config.rot13ServicePort - get the ROT-13 service port.
		 *
		 * Hints:
		 *
		 * 1. Your production code will get the port from WwwConfig, so you'll need to update the "config" line of
		 * your test to provide the port. Use a different port to prove that your test is working:
		 *    const config = WwwConfig.createNull({ rot13ServicePort: 999 });
		 *
		 * 2. Remember to update your assertion to use the new port:
		 *    assert.deepEqual(rot13Requests, [{
		 *      port: 999,           // The port of the ROT-13 service
		 *      text: "some text",   // The text sent to the service
		 *    }]);
		 *
		 * 3. When you run the test, it will fail because it expected port 999, but got port 123. This means your
		 * production code isn't using the port defined in the config.
		 *
		 * 4. Change your production code to get the port out of the config object. Like this:
		 *    await this._rot13Client.transformAsync(config.rot13ServicePort, "some text");
		 *
		 */

		/* CHALLENGE #2c: Parsing text
		 *
		 * Modify the test and production code created in Challenge #2a again. This time, change it to parse the request
		 * body rather than hard-coding the text. Use this request body:
		 *
		 *    const body = "text=hello%20world";
		 *
		 * This is URL-encoded form data that matches what a browser will send. Given this body, the controller should
		 * parse out the "text" field and send "hello world" to the ROT-13 service.
		 *
		 * Useful methods:
		 *
		 * 1. const request = HttpRequest.createNull({ body }) - create a request with the provided body. Note that
		 *      the parameter is an object with an optional field named "body". (To inline the body, use
		 *      "HttpRequest.createNull({ body: "text=hello%20world" })".)
		 * 2. const body = await request.readBodyAsync() - read the request body.
		 * 3. const formData = new URLSearchParams(body) - parse the request body. (URLSearchParams is part of the
		 *      standard library.)
		 * 4. const textFields = formData.getAll("text") - get an array containing the values of all "text" fields. It
		 *      will be empty if there are no "text" fields.
		 *
		 * Hints:
		 *
		 * 1. Your production code will read the request body from HttpRequest, so you need to update the "request" line
		 * of your test to provide the body. Like this:
		 *    const body = "text=hello%20world";
		 *    const request = HttpRequest.createNull({ body });
		 *
		 * 2. Update your assertion to use the new text field:
		 *    assert.deepEqual(rot13Requests, [{
		 *      port: 999,           // The port of the ROT-13 service
		 *      text: "hello world", // The text sent to the service
		 *    }]);
		 *
		 * 3. When you run the test, it will fail because it expected "hello world," but got "some text". This means
		 * your production code isn't reading the request body.
		 *
		 * 4. Change your production code to read the request body:
		 *    const body = await request.readBodyAsync();
		 *
		 * 5. Parse the request body:
		 *    const formData = new URLSearchParams(requestBody);
		 *    const textFields = formData.getAll("text");
		 *    const userInput = textFields[0];
		 *
		 * 6. Modify the ROT-13 request to use the request body:
		 *    await this._rot13Client.transformAsync(config.rot13ServicePort, userInput);

			/* CHALLENGE #3: Configuring responses
			 *
			 * This should be easier. It's a continuation of the last challenge. In the last challenge, you made the code
			 * call the ROT-13 server. In this challenge, you need to make it return the correct home page response.
			 * Specifically, the controller should return a web page with the translated ROT-13 string in the text field.
			 *
			 * Don't worry about server errors or edge cases for this challenge.
			 *
			 * When this challenge is complete, the code should work end to end. Check it manually as follows:
			 *    1. Run `.\serve_dev 5010 5011` (Windows) or `./serve_dev.sh 5010 5011` (Mac/Linux) from the command line
			 *    2. Access the page in a web browser: http://localhost:5010
			 *
			 * Useful methods:
			 *
			 * 1. const rot13Client = Rot13Client.createNull([{ response: "my_response" }]) - create a Rot13Client that
			 *      responds with "my_response" the first time it's called. Note that the parameter is an array of objects.
			 *      (If you wanted to control additional responses, you would add more objects to the array.)
			 * 2. const response = homePageView.homePage("my_text") - render the home page with "my_text" in the text field.
			 *
			 * Hints:
			 *
			 * 1. Just like in the last challenge, you'll need to create a Rot13Client in your test. But this time, you'll
			 * need to control what data it returns. You can do that by providing an array of objects, like this:
			 *    const rot13Client = Rot13Client.createNull([{ response: "my_response" }]);
			 *
			 * 2. You'll need a valid request body. Otherwise, your parsing logic will fail:
			 *    const request = HttpRequest.createNull({ body: "text=irrelevant_text" });
			 *
			 * (I like to use "irrelevant_xxx" for data that's required for the test to run, but not otherwise relevant
			 * to the test at hand.)
			 *
			 * 3. You'll need a controller and config, too, but you don't need to track requests or configure a specific
			 * port:
			 *      const controller = HomePageController.createNull({ rot13Client });
			 *      const config = WwwConfig.createNull();
			 *
			 * 4. You'll need to call postAsync() and check that it returns the correct response. This is just like
			 * challenge #1, except you need to render the expected ROT-13 response into the page. You can do that by
			 * passing it into homePageView.homePage():
			 *      const response = await controller.postAsync(request, config);
			 *      const expected = homePageView.homePage("my_response");
			 *      assert.deepEqual(response, expected);
			 *
			 * 5. When you run the test, it will fail with "expected undefined to deeply equal HttpResponse..." This is
			 * because postAsync() isn't returning a response.
			 *
			 * 6. Change your production code to return a hard-coded response:
			 *      return homePageView.homePage("hardcoded response");
			 *
			 * 7. This time, the test will fail with the wrong "_body" attribute in the response. It's a bit hard to read,
			 * because it's the full HTML of the page, but if you look for "<input type=\"text\" name=\"text\"...",
			 * you'll see that the value property is incorrect.
			 *
			 * 8. Change your production code to get the response from the Rot13Client and put it in the home page.
			 *      const output = await this._rot13Client.transformAsync(config.rot13ServicePort, userInput);
			 *      return homePageView.homePage(output);

			 *
			 * Useful methods:
			 *
			 * 1. const log = Log.createNull() - create a Log (an object that can write to the log).
			 * 2. const config = WwwConfig.createNull({ log }) - create a WwwConfig with the provided log. Note that the
			 *      parameter is an object with an optional field named "log".
			 * 3. const logOutput = log.trackOutput() - track logging. Similar to rot13Client.trackRequests(), this returns
			 *      a reference to an empty array on the heap. Every time a new log entry is written, an object is appended
			 *      to the array. The object has the log's alert level (in the "alert" field) and any other fields that
			 *      are written in that log entry. Fields containing Error objects are converted to strings.
			 * 4. const log = config.log - get the logger.
			 * 5. log.monitor(data) - write data to the log with the "monitor" alert level. Note that "data" is an object
			 *     that may contain any fields containing any values.
			 *
			 * Hints:
			 *
			 * 1. Your test needs to track log output. To do that, it needs to create a log instance, provide it to the
			 * config object, and track its output:
			 *    const log = Log.createNull();
			 *    const config = WwwConfig.createNull({ log });
			 *    const logOutput = log.trackOutput();
			 *
			 * 2. Your test needs to specify an empty request body:
			 *    const request = HttpRequest.createNull({ body: "" });
			 *
			 * 3. You also need a HomePageController, but you can use its default Rot13Client rather creating your own:
			 *    const controller = HomePageController.createNull();
			 *
			 * 4. You'll need to call postAsync() and confirm that it returns the correct response:
			 *    const response = await controller.postAsync(request, config);
			 *    assert.deepEqual(response, homePageView.homePage());
			 *
			 * 5. To break the test into smaller pieces, get this much passing before implementing the logging. When you
			 * run the test, it will probably fail with the error "Argument #2 must be a string, but it was undefined."
			 * This is happening because formData.getAll("text") is returning an empty array, because it can't find any
			 * form fields named "text". So "undefined" is being passed into rot13Client.transformAsync().
			 *
			 * 6. To fix the production code, introduce a guard clause after the getAll() line:
			 *    const textFields = formData.getAll("text");   // already exists
			 *    if (textFields.length === 0) {                // new code

			 *
			 * 8. When you run the test, it will fail saying that the logOutput is an empty array. This is because the
			 * production code isn't writing to the log.
			 *
			 * 9. Update your guard clause to write to the log. Rather than hardcoding the body, pass in the "body"
			 * variable.

			 * 3. Because you have to call advanceNullTimersAsync AFTER calling postAsync(), you can't "await" the result
			 * of postAsync() in your test. If you do, the call to advanceNullTimersAsync() will never execute. Instead, you
			 * have to store the promise, advance the clock, and then await the promise. Like this:
			 *    const responsePromise = controller.postAsync(request, config);
			 *    await clock.advanceNullTimersAsync();
			 *    const response = await responsePromise;
			 *
			 * 4. In your production code, use Clock.timeoutAsync() to implement the timeout, like this:
			 *    const output = await this._clock.timeoutAsync(timeoutInMs, transformPromise, timeoutFn);
			 *
			 * "timeoutInMs" is the number of milliseconds to wait before timing out.
			 * "transformPromise" is the promise to wait for (in this case, the output of Rot13Client.transform)
			 * "timeoutFn" is the function to call if the promise times out.
			 *
			 * PART (b)
			 *
			 * 5. In your tests, to check if the request was cancelled, you'll need to track requests like in
			 * challenge #2. Cancellations are appended to the request array. A request followed by a cancellation
			 * looks like this:
			 *    assert.deepEqual(rot13Requests, [{
			 *      port: 9999,
			 *      text: "my_input",
			 *    }, {
			 *      port: 9999,
			 *      text: "my_input",
			 *      cancelled: true,
			 *    }]);
			 *
			 * 6. In your production code, you can cancel a request by using the "cancelFn" variable returned by
			 * rot13Client.transform(). Like this:
			 *    const { transformPromise, cancelFn } = rot13Client.transform(port, text);
			 *    ...
			 *    cancelFn();   // cancels the request
			 *
			 * 7. After everything is working, be sure to look for opportunities to refactor the tests and production code.
